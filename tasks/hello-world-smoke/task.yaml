  Perform a minimal smoke-task implementation to validate Harbor orchestration end-to-end.

  Requirements:
  1. Edit `src/app/page.tsx`.
  2. Replace the scaffold placeholder content with the exact text: `Harbor smoke test ready`.
  3. Keep the file valid TSX.
  4. Run `bun run typecheck` and `bun run lint`.

  Do not make unrelated changes.
  Only report completion after the requested edit is complete.
