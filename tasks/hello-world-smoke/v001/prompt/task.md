Perform a minimal smoke-task implementation to validate Harbor orchestration end-to-end.

Requirements:
1. Edit `src/app/page.tsx`.
2. Replace the scaffold placeholder content with the exact text: `Harbor smoke test ready`.
3. Keep the file valid TSX.
4. Run `bun run typecheck` and `bun run lint`.

Do not make unrelated changes.
Only report completion after the requested edit is complete.
