  Implement a homepage for a SaaS product landing page.

  The page should include:
  1. A header with logo and navigation links (Home, About, Contact)
  2. A hero section with headline, subheadline, and call-to-action button
  3. A features section displaying 3 features in a grid
  4. A footer with copyright text

  The design reference image is available at ./reference/homepage.png

  Use the existing project setup with shadcn/ui components.
  Run `bun run dev` to start the development server.
  Run `bun run build` to verify the build succeeds.
  Run `bun test` to run the test suite.
