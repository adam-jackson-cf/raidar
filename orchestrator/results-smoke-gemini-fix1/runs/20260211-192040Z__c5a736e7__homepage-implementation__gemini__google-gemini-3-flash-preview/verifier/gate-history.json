Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.\nnpm warn deprecated glob@7.2.3: Old versions of glob are not supported, and contain widely publicized security vulnerabilities, which have been fixed in the current version. Please update. Support for old versions may be purchased (at exorbitant rates) by contacting i@izs.me\nnpm warn deprecated har-validator@5.1.5: this library is no longer supported\nnpm warn deprecated uuid@3.4.0: Please upgrade  to version 7 or higher.  Older versions may use Math.random() in certain circumstances, which is known to be problematic.  See https://v8.dev/blog/math-random for details.\nnpm warn deprecated rimraf@2.7.1: Rimraf versions prior to v4 are no longer supported\nnpm warn deprecated request-promise@3.0.0: request-promise has been deprecated because it extends the now deprecated request package, see https://github.com/request/request/issues/3142\nnpm warn deprecated fs-promise@0.5.0: Use mz or fs-extra^3.0 with Promise Support\nnpm warn deprecated request@2.88.2: request has been deprecated, see https://github.com/request/request/issues/3142\nnpm warn deprecated core-js@2.6.12: core-js@<3.23.3 is no longer maintained and not recommended for usage due to the number of issues. Because of the V8 engine whims, feature detection in old core-js versions could cause a slowdown up to 100x even if nothing is polyfilled. Some versions have web compatibility issues. Please, upgrade your dependencies to the actual version of core-js.\n",
