Implement a homepage for a SaaS product landing page.

The page should include:
1. A header with logo and navigation links (Home, About, Contact)
2. A hero section with headline, subheadline, and call-to-action button
3. A features section displaying 3 features in a grid
4. A footer with copyright text

Use the existing project setup with shadcn/ui components.
Run `bun run typecheck`.
Run `bun run lint`.
Run `bun run test:coverage` and ensure coverage is at least 80%.
Run `bun run build` to verify the build succeeds.

Add or update tests so every task requirement is covered.
Keep scaffold quality gate scripts intact.
Only report completion after all required verification commands succeed.

You are working in `/app`.
Follow rules in `/app/AGENTS.md`.
