I will read `src/app/page.tsx` and `package.json` to understand the current content and identify the project's verification commands.
I'm updating `src/app/page.tsx` to include the smoke test text and then I'll verify the changes with the project's build and linting tools.
I will now run the project's type-checking, linting, and testing commands to ensure the changes are valid and don't break the build.
