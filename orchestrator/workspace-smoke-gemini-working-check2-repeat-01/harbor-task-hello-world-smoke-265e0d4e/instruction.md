Requirements:
1. Edit `src/app/page.tsx`.
2. Replace the scaffold placeholder content with the exact text: `Harbor smoke test ready`.
3. Keep the file valid TSX.
4. Run only `bun run typecheck` for verification.

Do not make unrelated changes.
Do not run lint or test commands for this smoke task.
Only report completion after the requested edit is complete.

You are working in `/app`.
Follow rules in `/app/AGENTS.md`.
